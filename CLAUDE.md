# WiseMoney — Project State

> Seeded by `/mishkan-init`. This is the lean, dynamic project state artifact.
> It loads after the user-level harness identity and is injected last (after the
> cached static prefix) so sprint state stays at the end of context.

## Project

- **Name:** WiseMoney
- **What:** Local-first personal-finance PWA (mobile-first) on three equal pillars —
  Financial State (tracking), Financial Intelligence (multi-model AI guidance),
  Financial Literacy (conversational learning). Surfaces: Dashboard, Capture, Assistant.
- **Stack:** React + TypeScript PWA (Vite · service worker · Dexie/IndexedDB · Web
  Crypto AES-GCM · client-side event-sourcing) — **all domain logic is client-side**.
  Thin **Go** managed edge (net/http+chi · golang-jwt · x/crypto/argon2) doing
  auth → rate-limit → AI provider routing/fan-out/fallback → response normalization.
  **Postgres** (auth + rate-limit metadata only — never financial data). Docker
  Compose, pinned, distroless Go image. BYO-key mode bypasses the edge entirely.
- **Cognee namespace:** wisemoney
- **Initialised:** 2026-06-02

## Design artifacts (in `docs/`)

- `docs/PRD.md` — product requirements
- `docs/SRS.md` — software requirements (MVP cut; FR-AUTH; Gate-5 additions)
- `docs/CONTRACT.md` — invariants + guarantees (INV-EGR-03 mode-split amended)
- `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` — system architecture
- `docs/THREAT_MODEL.md` — STRIDE security threat model
- `docs/diagrams/C4/` — C4 diagrams (Context / Container / Component)
- `docs/adr/` — architecture decision records (ADR-0001…0009)
- `docs/runbooks/` — operational runbooks (stubs)
- `docs/intake/intent-v0.1.md` — source intent + full decision log (locked + Gate-1…5)

## Current sprint

- **Sprint:** S0
- **Milestone:** Initialisation complete — specification baseline (PRD → SRS →
  CONTRACT → ARCHITECTURE → THREAT_MODEL → C4 → docs) established and internally
  consistent.
- **Mode:** execution

### Tasks

<!-- maintained by Nehemiah; conforms to sprint-state.schema.json -->
- **T-S0-01** — MODELING (*done*): UML set in `docs/diagrams/UML/` + persistence
  schema in `docs/modeling/data-model.md` (IndexedDB/Dexie stores + encryption
  boundary, Postgres `users`/`refresh_tokens`, migrations DESIGNED not executed).
  Refinements: added `goal_contribution_recorded` event type (INV-EVT-04); rate-limit
  reconciled to in-memory (Gate-4 #20). Money = integer minor units + ISO-4217.
  *Carry-forward (implementation-time):* DQ-01 projection-staleness rebuild strategy;
  DQ-02 atomic key-rotation. (DQ-03 export format — resolved: decrypted portable JSON;
  encrypted variant = passphrase-wrapped; keyMeta + BYO keys excluded from plaintext.)
- **T-S0-02** — AI provider data-handling terms (*verified 2026-06-05*): OpenAI API
  (no-train default, 30d), Gemini paid (no-train, 55d) / free (TRAINS → banned), NVIDIA
  hosted (trains + §4.3 prohibits financial data → **dropped**), OpenRouter (free models
  require training-opt-in → redacted-only). **Strategy DECIDED → ADR-0011:** managed =
  free models REDACTED-only (OpenRouter + Gemini-free); full-egress = **BYO-key only**;
  paid managed deferred. Records: ARCH §9a/§9b, CONTRACT §8, THREAT_MODEL §2.1/§7, runbook.
  *Remaining (Y4NN/ops, gates launch of managed full-egress only):* legal sign-off;
  consent-UI provider naming; chase UNVERIFIED items (OpenAI ZDR financial eligibility,
  NVIDIA prod subscription, OpenRouter toggle/ZDR free list, region/GDPR).
- **T-S0-03** — Scaffold (*done*): `apps/web` (React/TS PWA, 27 files) + `services/edge`
  (Go, 22 files) + root contract (compose, env, README, SECURITY). Pinned, idiomatic,
  typed stubs citing FR/INV; **no installs/builds run** — run sequence in `README.md`.
  *Follow-ups:* `/dep-audit` before `pnpm install` (frontend added `@tanstack/react-query`
  + `@tanstack/react-router` beyond the zustand brief). **Routing lib DECIDED 2026-06-03:**
  TanStack Router confirmed/kept (Y4NN) — aligns with Panim rule; no `react-router` present.
- **T-S0-04** — `/dep-audit` (*done 2026-06-05*): cleared 2 CVSS-9.8 finds + more.
  Edge: pgx 5.7.4→5.9.2 (CVE-2026-33816), x/crypto 0.38.0→0.52.0 (argon2 path),
  chi 5.2.1→5.2.4, Go 1.23→1.25.11 (`toolchain` directive + Dockerfile, clears 51 stdlib).
  Frontend: vite→^7.3.5 / vitest→^4.1.8 (9.8) / plugin-react→^5.2.0 / vite-plugin-pwa→^1.3.0;
  Vite-7 target for portfolio alignment. osv-scanner v2.3.8 → both surfaces clean.
  Added `GOTOOLCHAIN=local`, `.github/workflows/security-scan.yml` (GitHub Actions —
  repo is GitHub-hosted; project override of the Migdal GitLab default), ADR-0010, scanning
  runbook, CHANGELOG. *Carry-forward (Migdal):* wire the edge **build stage** so the CI
  **binary-scan** gate (`osv-scanner scan binary`, authoritative) activates — currently
  guarded by `exists: dist/edge`; confirm `EDGE_BINARY_PATH` when build lands. **Y4NN runs
  `go mod tidy` (done) + commits; no installs/deploys by AI.**
- **T-S0-05** — Consent gate on `/v1/ai/proxy` (*done 2026-06-05*): `consentSvc.Verify`
  wired into the proxy handler (Hizkiah); fail-closed→redacted on any verify failure, then
  structural cap (`egress.Validator`) yields 400 on full-only fields. Feature transport pinned:
  **`X-Feature` header** (ARCHITECTURE §10a amended). 10 gate tests pass (build+vet+test via
  golang:1.25.11 container); Uriah QA **PASS** — no bypass path, JWT-sub sole identity, no
  payload logged. *Client carry-forward:* `apps/web/src/ai/orchestration.ts` managed path must
  attach `X-Feature` + `X-Consent-Assertion` when implemented (still a stub).
- **Consent-assertion wire shape — PINNED** (ARCHITECTURE §10a): HMAC-SHA256, dedicated
  `CONSENT_SIGNING_KEY` (must differ from JWT key), `user_id`/`feature`/`level`/`exp`(~5m),
  `X-Consent-Assertion` + `X-Feature` headers, fail-closed→redacted. Wired end-to-end on the
  edge (config/consent/egress/proxy/router). Nonce-replay denylist deferred (short TTL; §10a).
- **T-S0-06** — Client auth-session **DECISION recorded** (*2026-06-05*, OQ-06 RESOLVED →
  ADR-0012): access JWT in-memory only; refresh token in AES-GCM-encrypted IndexedDB
  (master-key/WebAuthn-gated); session coupled to store-unlock; **no edge wire change**.
  Pinned: **INV-AUTH-06/07** (CONTRACT §5); M-EGR-04 (strict CSP/SRI) **escalated to a
  PRIMARY MVP control** (THREAT_MODEL §2.4/§6); edge **refresh-rotation reuse-detection**
  obligation added (M-AUTH-05, RFC 6749). *Implementation pending (Phase 2):* client session
  module (Panim) + edge refresh persistence/reuse-detection (Yasad; edge refresh is a stub).
- **T-S0-07** — Client crypto foundation (*2026-06-05, awaiting Y4NN verify*): implemented
  `crypto/envelope.ts` (AES-GCM-256, 96-bit IV) + `crypto/keyManagement.ts` (Argon2id master
  key via hash-wasm; setupMasterKey + verifyPassphrase; BYO seal/open; WebAuthn-PRF wrap/unwrap
  via **Gap-2 Option A** — transient raw bytes zeroed). Oholiab impl; **Joab QA PASS-WITH-NITS**
  (INV-KEY-02/03 satisfied; F1 key-usage minimized; nits→tests/residuals). Schema **Dexie v2**
  (`keyMeta.wrappedIv`, Shallum migration design). INV-KEY-03 clarified (transient wrap memory,
  CONTRACT rev c). **VERIFIED 2026-06-05** (post first `pnpm install`): `pnpm typecheck`
  green (project-wide), `pnpm test` **31 pass / 2 skip** (WebAuthn round-trips browser-only),
  crypto lint clean. Fixed: `tsconfig` `allowImportingTsExtensions`+`noEmit` (scaffold-wide,
  cleared ~20 TS5097), AES-GCM `Uint8Array<ArrayBuffer>` normalization, WebAuthn `prf` ext type.
- **T-S0-08** — Edge auth completion (*2026-06-05*): wired `register`/`login`/`refresh` to the
  (real) repos; Argon2id **PHC** hash/verify (constant-time); login **timing-equalized** via a
  cfg-param dummy hash; refresh **rotation + reuse-detection** (revoked token → `RevokeAllForUser`
  family-invalidation, RFC 6749). Hizkiah impl. **Uriah QA PASS**; **Joab security PASS-WITH-NITS**
  — caught + fixed a MEDIUM timing-oracle (dummy was `t=1` vs prod `t≥3`) and pinned JWT **HS256**
  (`WithValidMethods`, closing HS384/512 confusion); PHC parser upper-bounds added. Fixed repo
  `ErrNoRows` bug (FindByEmail/ID/TokenHash → `(nil,nil)`). build+vet+test green (golang:1.25.11).
  *Carry-forward (Yasad — Zerubbabel/Shallum):* refresh rotation is non-atomic (revoke→create,
  pool-based repos) → concurrent double-issuance race; needs **tx-variant repo methods**. Handler
  integration tests deferred (need Postgres/testcontainers + repo interfaces). Login rate-limit
  (M-AUTH-01) still TODO. Register-409 enumeration accepted (THREAT_MODEL §2.3). **Edge run needs
  Y4NN to apply Postgres migrations** (golang-migrate `0001_init`).
  *Then:* client session module (depends on T-S0-07) wires login/refresh + token storage.
- **T-S0-09** — Security-review triage + quick-wins (*2026-06-05*): triaged `security-review.md`
  (full-codebase review @ 4b8fec7) against current HEAD — **all 3 HIGH closed/neutralised**
  (HIGH-02 ErrNoRows + LOW-02/03 already resolved by S0-07/08; **HIGH-01 nonce-replay
  DEFERRED** — ADR-0011 removed its exploit path, gate to managed-full-egress launch). Quick-wins
  shipped: **MED-01** body-size limits (`withBodyLimit`: 8 KiB auth/consent, 1 MiB proxy, 413),
  **HIGH-03-max** password≤128/email≤254, **MED-04** `.env.example` `sslmode=require`, **LOW-04**
  `main.tsx` PROD-https assertion. All green (edge container + web typecheck/lint). Triage appended
  to `security-review.md` (now tracked). *Tracked-open (gated, not blocking):* MED-02 CORS + MED-03
  edge-headers/PWA-CSP → **staging deploy** (Eliashib/Huram); MED-05 structured logging + LOW-01
  auth rate-limit → **pre-login-launch** (Zerubbabel); HIGH-01 nonce denylist → **managed-full-egress
  launch**; INFO-01/02 ongoing.
- **T-S0-10** — Client auth-session module (*2026-06-05*): `api/edgeClient.ts` (typed
  register/login/refresh, Bearer attach, HTTPS-guarded), `auth/session.ts` (zustand,
  **access JWT in-memory only**, refresh token **sealed via crypto envelope** into a new
  **`authSession` Dexie v3 store**, on-demand refresh + rotation, 401→clear+delete,
  `restoreSession` on unlock, logout). Oholiab impl; Shallum v3 design (data-model). **Joab
  security PASS-WITH-NITS** (INV-AUTH-06/07 satisfied; closed CWE-319 edgeClient HTTPS
  self-guard + CWE-668 `_sessionStore` unexport) + **Jahaziel QA PASS**. 59 web tests pass /
  2 skip; typecheck+lint 0. INV-AUTH-06 (in-memory access, sealed refresh) + INV-AUTH-07
  (unlock-coupled, no background refresh) enforced + tested.
- **T-S0-11** — AI orchestration MANAGED path (*2026-06-05*): `submit` managed branch wired —
  `getAccessToken(masterKey)`→Bearer, consent→`X-Egress-Level`+`X-Feature`+(`X-Consent-Assertion`
  on full), `postAiProxy`→edge `/v1/ai/proxy`; 401→refresh+retry-once; 503→`ProviderUnavailableSignal`
  (INV-PROXY-04); 200→normalized. Salma impl; **Jahaziel QA PASS**, **Joab security PASS-WITH-NITS**.
  BYO-direct path still a stub (separate slice).
  **MEDIUM — RESOLVED (Salma + Joab re-verify PASS, MEDIUM CLOSED):** full-consent + missing/expired
  assertion now **re-acquires** via `postConsentAssert` (`POST /v1/consent/assert`, 401→refresh+retry),
  and on failure **gracefully downgrades** — `toRedacted()` strips full-only fields so a full-shaped
  body is NEVER sent under a `redacted` header (safety property verified; no PII-egress path). web
  tests now ~88 pass / 2 skip; typecheck+lint 0. *LOW nits tracked (non-blocking):* inner catch
  swallows refresh errors (re-emit when observability wired — Hanun); `postAiProxy` could use a
  discriminated-union type (edge enforces anyway); extract an edgeClient `request()` primitive.
- **Scaffold quality gates GREEN (2026-06-05):** first real verify surfaced gate failures, now
  fixed — `tsconfig` `allowImportingTsExtensions`+`noEmit`; eslint `no-unused-vars` honors the
  `^_` convention; 61 stub lint errors cleared **without implementing product logic** (async
  stubs → non-async `Promise.reject`, behaviorally identical; dead imports removed). Full
  `apps/web`: **lint 0 · typecheck 0 · test 31 pass/2 skip**.

### Blockers

<!-- raised by any agent; Mishmar flags carry highest priority -->
- None blocking development. (T-S0-02 verified + strategy decided (ADR-0011); residual
  *launch*-gate is now only managed full-egress, which is deferred — so not blocking MVP.)

### Open flags

- **[Mishmar — accepted residual]** Full-egress sends raw financial PII to third-party
  AI providers; provider-side retention is irreducibly outside user control once it
  egresses. Mitigated by per-feature consent + redacted-default + disclosure; residual
  accepted by design. (THREAT_MODEL headline; ADR-0001.)
- **[Mishmar]** Consent state lives in localStorage (unencrypted, user-clearable);
  egress enforcement must be server-boundary in managed mode (structural payload cap
  + signed consent assertion, FR-AUTH-06) and is client-side/user-as-principal in
  BYO-key mode (INV-EGR-03 amended). (ADR-0008.)
- **[Mishmar — MODELING residual]** IndexedDB plaintext index keys (timestamps,
  event types, entity-ref counts, period structure) leak *activity timing and volume*
  to an adversary with device read access — never amounts or merchant detail. Accepted
  trade-off for offline-first queryability; fold into THREAT_MODEL on next revision.
- **[Product]** Personas: Overwhelmed Tracker is the sole MVP primary; the other two
  are secondary/future and remain unvalidated.
- **[Scope]** Multi-currency, multi-provider, encrypted export, and a multi-tenant
  hosted proxy are all in MVP — heavier than a minimal build; chosen deliberately.
